# OC-GIGABYTE-Z170-GAMING-K3

OpenCore configuration for the Gigabyte GA-Z170 Gaming K3 motherboard

## NOTE

I am only making this public because sharing is caring. I have not used macOS in a long time and I do not plan on using it again. This configuration may also not function, as it was last tested on High Sierra (10.13), and initially written for Sierra (10.12).

I will take pull requests to fix up the configuration, but please do not create any issues in the hopes of me fixing it. I won't.
